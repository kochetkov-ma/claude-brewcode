# KNOWLEDGE.jsonl Format

## Record Structure

```jsonl
{"ts":"ISO8601","t":"type","txt":"knowledge text","src":"agent-name"}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ts` | string | ISO8601 timestamp (e.g., "2026-01-26T14:00:00") |
| `t` | string | Type: `❌` (avoid), `✅` (best practice), `ℹ️` (info) |
| `txt` | string | Knowledge text - what was learned |
| `src` | string | Source agent name (e.g., "developer", "tester") |

## Types Priority

| Type | Priority | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| `❌` | 1 (highest) | What NOT to do - mistakes, failures |
| `✅` | 2 | Best practices - what works well |
| `ℹ️` | 3 (lowest) | Neutral information - facts |

## Examples

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-01-26T14:00:00","t":"❌","txt":"Do not use SELECT * in production queries","src":"sql_expert"}
{"ts":"2026-01-26T14:05:00","t":"✅","txt":"Use @Valid annotation for request DTOs","src":"developer"}
{"ts":"2026-01-26T14:10:00","t":"ℹ️","txt":"DBRider resets sequences after each test","src":"tester"}
{"ts":"2026-01-26T15:00:00","t":"❌","txt":"mem_limit only, not deploy.resources in non-Swarm","src":"developer"}
```

## Compaction Rules

1. Remove exact duplicates
2. Merge semantically similar entries
3. Keep `❌` over `✅` over `ℹ️`
4. Limit to N entries per agent (configurable)
5. Preserve most recent entries when trimming
